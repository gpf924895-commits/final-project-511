# Sheikh Edit/Delete Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Sheikh Edit/Delete functionality, which allows Sheikhs to manage only their own lectures with proper filtering, editing, and deletion capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Edit Lecture Page (`/sheikh/edit`)

**Purpose**: Allows Sheikhs to edit only their own lectures with filtered access.

**Key Features**:
- **Filtered Access**: Only shows lectures where `sheikhId == currentUser.uid`
- **Edit Restrictions**: Cannot change `sheikhId` (ownership protection)
- **Editable Fields**: Title, description, start/end time, location, media
- **Validation**: Same validation as add form (future time, URL format, etc.)
- **Ownership Verification**: Server-side checks ensure only own lectures can be edited

**Data Flow**:
```
Sheikh Home → "تعديل" button → Edit Page → Select Lecture → Edit Form → Save
```

**Security Measures**:
- Client-side filtering by `sheikhId`
- Server-side ownership verification
- No access to other Sheikhs' lectures
- Form pre-filled with existing data

### 2. Delete Lecture Page (`/sheikh/delete`)

**Purpose**: Allows Sheikhs to delete only their own lectures with soft delete and permanent delete options.

**Key Features**:
- **Filtered Access**: Only shows lectures where `sheikhId == currentUser.uid`
- **Two-Tier Deletion**:
  - **Soft Delete (Archive)**: Sets `status = "archived"` (default)
  - **Permanent Delete**: Sets `deletedAt` and removes document (requires confirmation)
- **Visual Separation**: Active and archived lectures shown in separate sections
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Different dialogs for archive vs permanent delete

**Data Flow**:
```
Sheikh Home → "إزالة" button → Delete Page → Select Lecture → Choose Action → Confirm
```

**Deletion Process**:
1. **Archive (Default)**: 
   - Sets `status = "archived"`
   - Sets `updatedAt = serverTimestamp()`
   - Lecture becomes hidden from active lists
   - Can be permanently deleted later

2. **Permanent Delete**:
   - Sets `deletedAt = serverTimestamp()`
   - Sets `status = "deleted"`
   - Document is effectively removed
   - Cannot be recovered

### 3. Data Model Compliance

**Firestore Collection**: `lectures`

**Edit Operation**:
```json
{
  "title": "string (updated)",
  "description": "string (updated)",
  "startTime": "Timestamp (updated)",
  "endTime": "Timestamp (updated)",
  "location": "object (updated)",
  "media": "object (updated)",
  "updatedAt": "Timestamp (server)",
  "sheikhId": "string (unchanged - ownership protection)"
}
```

**Archive Operation**:
```json
{
  "status": "archived",
  "updatedAt": "Timestamp (server)"
}
```

**Permanent Delete Operation**:
```json
{
  "deletedAt": "Timestamp (server)",
  "status": "deleted"
}
```

### 4. Security & Access Control

**Client-Side Protection**:
- Filtered queries: `where('sheikhId', '==', currentUser.uid)`
- UI only shows own lectures
- Form validation prevents unauthorized access

**Server-Side Protection**:
- Ownership verification in all operations
- `sheikhId` cannot be changed during edits
- Archive/delete operations verify ownership
- No access to other Sheikhs' data

**Validation Rules**:
- Only authenticated Sheikhs can access
- Only own lectures can be edited/deleted
- Time validation (future dates)
- URL format validation for media
- Overlap prevention for time slots

### 5. User Experience

**Edit Flow**:
1. Sheikh Home → "تعديل" button
2. Select lecture from filtered list
3. Edit form with pre-filled data
4. Save changes with validation
5. Success confirmation and navigation

**Delete Flow**:
1. Sheikh Home → "إزالة" button
2. View active and archived lectures
3. Select lecture for deletion
4. Choose archive or permanent delete
5. Confirm action with appropriate dialog
6. Success confirmation and list refresh

**Visual Design**:
- **Active Lectures**: Red theme, "اضغط للحذف" action
- **Archived Lectures**: Orange theme, "اضغط للحذف النهائي" action
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status chips
- **Section Headers**: Clear separation between active/archived
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Different styles for archive vs permanent delete

### 6. Technical Implementation

**Files Modified**:

1. **`lib/screens/sheikh/edit_lecture_page.dart`**
   - Filtered lecture loading
   - Edit form with ownership protection
   - Validation and save functionality

2. **`lib/screens/sheikh/delete_lecture_page.dart`**
   - Dual-section display (active/archived)
   - Archive and permanent delete dialogs
   - Visual differentiation for lecture states

3. **`lib/provider/lecture_provider.dart`**
   - `updateSheikhLecture()` method
   - `archiveSheikhLecture()` method
   - `deleteSheikhLecture()` method
   - Error handling and loading states

4. **`lib/database/firebase_service.dart`**
   - `updateSheikhLecture()` method
   - `archiveSheikhLecture()` method
   - `deleteSheikhLecture()` method
   - Ownership verification

**Key Methods**:

**LectureProvider.updateSheikhLecture()**:
```dart
Future<bool> updateSheikhLecture({
  required String lectureId,
  required String sheikhId,
  required String title,
  String? description,
  required DateTime startTime,
  DateTime? endTime,
  Map<String, dynamic>? location,
  Map<String, dynamic>? media,
}) async
```

**LectureProvider.archiveSheikhLecture()**:
```dart
Future<bool> archiveSheikhLecture({
  required String lectureId,
  required String sheikhId,
}) async
```

**LectureProvider.deleteSheikhLecture()**:
```dart
Future<bool> deleteSheikhLecture({
  required String lectureId,
  required String sheikhId,
}) async
```

### 7. Testing
