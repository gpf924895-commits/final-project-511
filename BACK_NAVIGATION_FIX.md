# Back Navigation Fix - Summary

## Problem
The back arrow (←) was not showing on several screens. Instead, only the hamburger menu icon (☰) was displayed.

## Root Cause
When a Flutter Scaffold has a `drawer` property, Flutter automatically shows the hamburger menu icon in the `leading` position of the AppBar, replacing the default back arrow.

## Solution
Added explicit back arrow buttons to all screens with drawers while keeping the drawer accessible via a menu button in the actions area.

## Fixed Screens (9 Total)

### 1. ✅ Settings Page (`lib/screens/settings_page.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right to access drawer

### 2. ✅ Notifications Page (`lib/screens/notifications_page.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right to access drawer

### 3. ✅ Profile Page (`lib/screens/profile_page.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right to access drawer

### 4. ✅ Fiqh Section Page (`lib/screens/fiqh_section.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right (after refresh button)
- Keeps existing refresh functionality

### 5. ✅ Hadith Section Page (`lib/screens/hadith_section.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right (after refresh button)
- Keeps existing refresh functionality

### 6. ✅ Tafsir Section Page (`lib/screens/tafsir_section.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right (after refresh button)
- Keeps existing refresh functionality

### 7. ✅ Seerah Section Page (`lib/screens/seerah_section.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right (after refresh button)
- Keeps existing refresh functionality

### 8. ✅ Mosque Map Page (`lib/screens/mosque_map_page.dart`)
- Added back arrow on the left
- Added menu button on the right (after other action buttons)
- Keeps existing location and map functionality

## Implementation Details

### For simple pages (Settings, Notifications, Profile):
```dart
AppBar(
  leading: IconButton(
    icon: const Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
    onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
  ),
  actions: [
    Builder(
      builder: (context) => IconButton(
        icon: const Icon(Icons.menu),
        onPressed: () => Scaffold.of(context).openDrawer(),
      ),
    ),
  ],
),
```

### For section pages with existing actions:
```dart
AppBar(
  leading: IconButton(
    icon: const Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
    onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
  ),
  actions: [
    // Existing actions (e.g., refresh button)
    IconButton(
      icon: const Icon(Icons.refresh),
      onPressed: () { /* ... */ },
    ),
    // Menu button added conditionally
    if (widget.toggleTheme != null)
      Builder(
        builder: (context) => IconButton(
          icon: const Icon(Icons.menu),
          onPressed: () => Scaffold.of(context).openDrawer(),
        ),
      ),
  ],
),
```

## Navigation Flow

### Before Fix:
- User taps Settings from Home → Only ☰ icon shows (no back arrow)
- User taps Fiqh section → Only ☰ icon shows (no back arrow)
- User gets confused about how to go back

### After Fix:
- User taps Settings from Home → ← back arrow on left + ☰ menu on right
- User taps Fiqh section → ← back arrow on left + 🔄 refresh + ☰ menu on right
- User can easily navigate back using the arrow
- User can still access sidebar using the menu button

## Benefits
1. ✅ Clear navigation - back arrow always visible
2. ✅ Consistent UX across all screens
3. ✅ Drawer still accessible via menu button
4. ✅ Follows Material Design guidelines
5. ✅ No functionality lost
