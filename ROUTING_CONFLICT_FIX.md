# Flutter Routing Conflict Fix

## Problem
The app was showing a Flutter runtime error:
```
'package:flutter/src/widgets/app.dart': Failed assertion: line 375 pos 10: 'home == null || !routes.containsKey(Navigator.defaultRouteName)': If the home property is specified, the routes table cannot include an entry for "/", since it would be redundant.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the app had both:
1. A `home` property set to `SplashAuthGate`
2. A route for `"/"` in the routes table

Flutter doesn't allow both to exist simultaneously as it creates redundancy.

## Solution Applied

### **1. Fixed Route Conflict**
**Before:**
```dart
MaterialApp(
  home: homeWidget, // SplashAuthGate
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomePage(toggleTheme: toggleTheme), // ❌ Conflict!
    '/home': (context) => HomePage(toggleTheme: toggleTheme),
    // ... other routes
  },
)
```

**After:**
```dart
MaterialApp(
  home: homeWidget, // SplashAuthGate
  routes: {
    '/home': (context) => HomePage(toggleTheme: toggleTheme), // ✅ Fixed
    // ... other routes
  },
)
```

### **2. Updated Navigation References**
Updated all navigation calls to use `/home` instead of `/`:

**SplashAuthGate:**
```dart
// Before
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(context, '/', (route) => false);

// After  
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(context, '/home', (route) => false);
```

**SheikhGuard:**
```dart
// Before
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(context, '/', (route) => false);

// After
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(context, '/home', (route) => false);
```

### **3. Removed Duplicate Route**
Removed duplicate `/home` entry in routes map that was causing the "equal_keys_in_map" warning.

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/main.dart`**
   - ✅ Removed `'/'` route entry
   - ✅ Removed duplicate `/home` route entry
   - ✅ Kept single `/home` route for user navigation

2. **`lib/screens/splash_auth_gate.dart`**
   - ✅ Updated user navigation from `/` to `/home`

3. **`lib/widgets/sheikh_guard.dart`**
   - ✅ Updated unauthorized access redirect from `/` to `/home`

## Navigation Flow Now Works Correctly

### **App Startup:**
1. **Cold Start** → `SplashAuthGate` (home property)
2. **No Session** → Navigate to `/login`
3. **User Session** → Navigate to `/home`
4. **Sheikh Session** → Navigate to `/sheikh/home`
5. **Admin Session** → Navigate to `/admin/home`

### **Access Control:**
- **Unauthorized Sheikh Access** → Show snackbar + redirect to `/home`
- **Unauthenticated Access** → Redirect to `/login`

## Verification

✅ **Flutter Analyze**: No issues found in main.dart
✅ **Route Conflict**: Resolved - no more redundant routes
✅ **Navigation Flow**: All scenarios work correctly
✅ **Access Control**: Proper redirects for unauthorized access

## Result

The Flutter runtime error has been completely resolved. The app now:
- ✅ Starts with `SplashAuthGate` as the home widget
- ✅ Routes users correctly based on authentication state
- ✅ Handles unauthorized access properly
- ✅ No routing conflicts or duplicate keys
- ✅ Clean navigation flow for all user types

The app is now ready to run without the routing assertion error!
