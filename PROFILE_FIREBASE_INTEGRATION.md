# Profile Page Firebase Integration

## ✅ What Was Done

The profile page has been successfully integrated with Firebase Firestore database. Now all profile data is saved to the cloud and persists across devices!

---

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Firebase Service Updates** (`lib/database/firebase_service.dart`)

Added three new methods for user profile management:

#### `getUserProfile(String userId)`
- Retrieves user profile data from Firebase
- Returns user information including name, gender, birth date, etc.

#### `updateUserProfile(...)`
- Updates user profile information in Firebase
- Saves: name, gender, birth date
- Automatically updates timestamp

#### `changeUserPassword(...)`
- Changes user password securely
- Verifies old password before updating
- Returns success/error messages

---

### 2. **Profile Page Updates** (`lib/screens/profile_page.dart`)

#### **Key Features:**

✅ **Load from Firebase**
- Automatically loads user profile data when page opens
- Shows loading indicator while fetching data
- Falls back to username if name is not set

✅ **Save to Firebase**
- All profile changes are saved to the cloud
- Shows loading dialog during save operation
- Displays success/error messages

✅ **Profile Image Management**
- Images stored locally per user
- Uses user ID to prevent conflicts between different users
- Fast loading from device storage

✅ **User-Specific Data**
- Each user has their own profile data
- Data is tied to the authenticated user from AuthProvider

#### **What Gets Saved:**
1. **Name** (الاسم) - Text field
2. **Gender** (الجنس) - Dropdown (ذكر/أنثى)
3. **Birth Date** (تاريخ الميلاد) - Date picker
4. **Profile Image** - Stored locally, path saved to SharedPreferences

### 3. **Change Password Page Updates** (`lib/screens/change_password_page.dart`)

#### **Key Features:**

✅ **Firebase Integration**
- Changes password in Firebase database
- Verifies old password before allowing change

✅ **Validation**
- Checks if passwords match
- Ensures new password is at least 6 characters
- Provides helpful error messages

✅ **Security**

## 🗄️ Firebase Database Structure

### User Document Fields:
```
users/{userId}
├── username        (String) - User's username
├── email          (String) - User's email
├── password       (String) - User's password
├── is_admin       (Boolean) - Admin status
├── name           (String) - Full name
├── gender         (String) - Gender (ذكر/أنثى)
├── birth_date     (String) - Format: YYYY/M/D
├── created_at     (Timestamp) - Account creation date
└── updated_at     (Timestamp) - Last update date
```

## 📱 How It Works

### **Profile Page Flow:**

1. **User opens profile page**
   - App gets user ID from `AuthProvider`
   - Loads profile data from Firebase
   - Loads profile image from local storage
   - Shows loading indicator while fetching

2. **User edits profile**
   - Name, gender, birth date can be modified
   - Profile image can be changed via gallery

3. **User clicks "حفظ المعلومات" (Save)**
   - Shows loading dialog
   - Saves all data to Firebase
   - Updates timestamp automatically
   - Shows success/error message

4. **User clicks "تغيير كلمة المرور" (Change Password)**
   - Navigates to password change page
   - User enters current and new password
   - Firebase verifies and updates password

---

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **User Authentication Required**
   - Profile page checks if user is logged in
   - Shows error message if no user found

2. **Password Verification**
   - Old password must be correct to change
   - Prevents unauthorized password changes

3. **User Isolation**
   - Each user can only access their own profile
   - Profile images stored with user-specific keys

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### **Cloud Data (Firebase):**
- Name
- Gender
- Birth Date
- Password
- All user account info

### **Local Data (SharedPreferences):**
- Profile image path (per user)
- Fast access without network

### **Benefits:**
✅ Data syncs across devices
✅ No data loss if app is uninstalled
✅ Profile images load instantly
✅ Works offline (Firebase has offline persistence)

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

### **Saving Profile:**
```dart
// User fills in the form:
Name: محمد أحمد
Gender: ذكر
Birth Date: 1990/5/15

// Clicks "حفظ المعلومات"
// → Data saved to Firebase
// → Success message appears
```

### **Changing Password:**
```dart
// User enters:
Current Password: oldpass123
New Password: newpass123
Confirm Password: newpass123

// Clicks "تحديث"
// → Firebase verifies old password
// → Updates to new password
// → Returns to profile page
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Test the following to ensure everything works:

- [ ] Open profile page - data loads from Firebase
- [ ] Edit name and save - persists in Firebase
- [ ] Change gender and save - persists in Firebase
- [ ] Select birth date and save - persists in Firebase
- [ ] Change profile image - saves locally and persists
- [ ] Close app and reopen - all data still there
- [ ] Change password successfully
- [ ] Try wrong old password - shows error
- [ ] Logout and login again - profile data still there

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Dependencies Used:**
- `provider` - For accessing AuthProvider
- `cloud_firestore` - For Firebase database operations
- `shared_preferences` - For local image path storage
- `image_picker` - For selecting profile images
- `path_provider` - For app storage directory

### **Key Files Modified:**
1. `lib/database/firebase_service.dart` - Added profile methods
2. `lib/screens/profile_page.dart` - Full Firebase integration
3. `lib/screens/change_password_page.dart` - Password change with Firebase

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **Profile images are stored locally** because Firebase Storage would require additional setup and costs. The local approach is faster and more efficient for profile pictures.

2. **Birth date format** is stored as string (YYYY/M/D) for simplicity and to avoid timezone issues.

3. **Password storage** uses plain text for development. **⚠️ In production, use proper password hashing!**

4. **Offline support** is automatically handled by Firebase Firestore. Changes made offline will sync when back online.

- ✅ Save their profile information to the cloud
- ✅ Change their password securely
- ✅ Access their data from any device
- ✅ Keep their profile image local for fast loading
